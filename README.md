# VanillaPlus
A modpack styled plugin


VanillaPlus has been a modpack I've been working on for a little bit that involves bring elements from popular modpacks such as FeedTheBeast into the bukkit world. Currently VanillaPlus is a proof of concept, and doesn't have much to feature. Recipes and images will soon be added to the github repository once I find the plugin to be suitable for gameplay.

# Features
Coal Generator - Generates VoxelUnits (VU) to wirelessly power other structures using coal
Quarry - Consumes VU in order to dig a region down to bedrock. 
Crafting Terminal - A very similar structure to the AE2 crafting terminal
